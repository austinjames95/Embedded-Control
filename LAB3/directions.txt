The following document is how the numbers translate to directions

First Number of the 3 digits (I.E. [x]23) = The movement direction
1 = forward (would need time
2 = move 90 degrees right (would only be 2 because no time needed)
3 = move 90 degrees left (would only be 3 because no time needed)
4 = turn around 180 degrees (would only be 4 becuase no time needed)
5 = turn 48 degrees down (would only be 5 becuase no time needed)

Second Number and Third Number of the 3 digits (I.E. 1[x][y]) = The time it should move
